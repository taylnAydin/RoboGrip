# **RoboGrip**

üéÆ **A robotic arm controlled via joystick and powered by Arduino Uno R3.**

## üöÄ Features:
- **Joystick Control**: Use the analog X and Y joystick to control the movement of the robotic arm's servo motors.
- **Servo Motors**: Four high-torque servos for precise control of the robotic arm.
- **LED Display**: Displays the robot's current mood status on the screen.
- **Button Control**: Toggle the robot's functionality on and off using a red button.
- **Sound Feedback**: The robot uses a buzzer for sound feedback when it is activated or deactivated.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:
- **Arduino Uno R3**: The main microcontroller driving the robot's logic and hardware.
- **Servo Motors**: For moving the robotic arm in various directions.
- **LED Display**: Used for displaying the robot's mood or status.
- **Joystick**: An analog joystick used for controlling the movement of the robotic arm.
- **Buzzer**: Provides auditory feedback for various actions like powering on or off.

## üìñ How to Run:
1. **Clone the repository**:
   - To get started with the RoboGrip project, clone the repository to your local machine:
   
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/taylnAydin/RoboGrip.git
     cd RoboGrip
     ```

2. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Connect your **Arduino Uno R3** to your computer.
   - Set up the four servo motors to control the robotic arm.
   - Connect the joystick and the red button for control, and connect the LED screen and buzzer as per the wiring instructions in the project.

3. **Upload the Code**:
   - Open the **RoboGrip.ino** file using the **Arduino IDE**.
   - Upload the code to the **Arduino Uno R3**.

4. **Test the Robot**:
   - Once the code is uploaded, use the joystick to control the movement of the robotic arm.
   - Press the red button to toggle the robot's functionality.
   - Watch the LED display change according to the robot's status, and listen for the buzzer's feedback.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Game Progression:
The robot reacts to user input as follows:
- **Joystick Movement**: Moves the robotic arm based on the X and Y axis of the joystick.
- **Button Press**: Toggles the robot on or off, with corresponding feedback from the buzzer and LED display.

## üéµ Sound and Feedback:
- **Buzzer**: Provides auditory feedback for the robot‚Äôs on/off state.
- **LED Display**: Displays the robot's mood status based on the joystick's current position.
